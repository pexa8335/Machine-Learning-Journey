# Summary key knowledge.

Concepts of Machine Learning, Supervised and Unsupervised learning, overfitting, and underfitting.
Imputation techniques for missing values: mean, mode, median, or imputing with predicted values using Bayes or ML.
Introduced how to decrease data size using clustering techniques: PCA, T-SNE.
Learned [[3.1 - Linear Regression.]] from YouTube - the full form of **Linear Regression**, Loss function (OLS), and Regularization.

Learned [[Lecture content/02 - Linear Regression & Gradient Descent/Linear Regression.|Linear Regression.]] from scratch: how it behaves in its most basic form, from $w_{0}x$ to $w_{0} + w_{1}x$, why we need $w_{0}$ to act as an intercept, and its loss function (MSE).
